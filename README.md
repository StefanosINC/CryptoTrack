# CryptoTrack
## General Summary
General Summary: The goal for this project is to be on the App store and to leverage the technologies and tools I learned over the summer. This app will be a mobile application that allows users to create an account and add certain cryptos to their watch list. This application will be a better place to manage what cryptocurrencies you are into. Different chart setups and diagrams are open for discussions as getting familiar with how to pull live data from these cryptos is the goal. I think diving into a variety of different chart patterns and exploring ways to pull news feeds back your crypto would be great. If you add them to your watch list, you will get news feeds based on that specific crypto currency. Also there will be a general form of news coming in about Bitcoin and the general state of the market to the app. This application will be strictly on the mobile app for primary use, there will need to be a landing page for you to go to and it will link you to download the app. 

## Technical Decisions
From a technical standpoint, I want to leverage the ability to write asynchronous code, callbacks, latest standards of proper javascript in ES6 or whatever the best standard is. Managing Code with github is a mandatory standard and performing proper unit test.

## Technologies Used
JavaScript, Node, Express, React Native, MongoDB/Mongoose.
